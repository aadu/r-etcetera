\title{Delete zero var}
\usage{
delete_zero_var(data, delete = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.table containing columns to be deleted}

\item{delete}{boolean -- whether or not to actually delete the columns}
}
\value{
data.table reference (it does not pass by value remember)
}
\description{
Delete all columns in a data table that have one unique value
}
\details{
This function passes the data table by reference, so be warned that \code{data} will always be
changed. If you run with delete = FALSE, it will list out the columns to be deleted, but will not delete them.
This is advised while testing out regular expressions.

#vf = delete_zero_var(vf)
